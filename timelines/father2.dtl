father: You're probably wondering how to get past this pit...
father: You can't jump far enough to get past it, but worry not! You can teleport.
father: Hold [RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON] and you will see a vision appear of an error indicating where you will teleport when you release [RIGHT MOUES BUTTON]. Look around to change it's position.
father: Another thing, teleporing uses blood so harvest some from the nearby rats
